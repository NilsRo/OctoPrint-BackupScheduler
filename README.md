# Backup Scheduler

This plugin allows you to schedule OctoPrint backups at regular configured intervals. If a print is on going at the time of initializing the backup  the backup will be delayed until the ongoing print is completed, cancelled, or fails.

**WARNING**: This plugin currently does not monitor your disk usage in any way.

**NOTE**: The time settings are based on the device's local time that OctoPrint is running on. For octopi users use `sudo raspi-config` to set your time and appropriate timezone.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
